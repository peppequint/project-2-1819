## Research

There are many improvements possible on the website of CMD Amsterdam. To see what the possibilities are, I ran an audit to see what is happening.

To my surprise, the grading of the website was an one out of hundred. Mostly, the images are to big and there is a lot of unused CSS and HTML elements.
